# Face Recognition with OpenCV

- OpenCV has a built in face recognizer. We must train the recognizer so this is similar to building a baby-sized deep learning model
  
  #### Creating Training Data

- Create a list of all the people in the image. If the faces to train no are in folders titled with the name of the person, you can do this automatically with:

- ```python
  p = []
  for i in os.listdir(r'Faces/train'):
      p.append(i)
  ```

- Then make a variable for the directory of your training data and create a Haar cascade variable.
  
  ```python
  DIR = r'Faces/train'
  haar_cascade = cv.CascadeClassifier('haar_face.xml')
  ```

- Then two empty lists for the **create_train()** function to use.
  
  ```python
  features = []    # what are the features of the face?
  labels = []      # what is the label attributed to it?
  ```

- The **create_train()** function will train out recognizer. The first part is to 
  
  ```python
  def create_train():
      for person in p:                      # for each folder in the training folder
          path = os.path.join(DIR, person)  # make a path to that person's folder
          label = people.index(person)      # this will let us assign a single
                                              # number to this, reducing load
  
      for img in os.listdir(path):          # for each image in the person's folder
              img_path = os.path.join(path,img) # make a path to that image
              img_array = cv.imread(img_path) # read the image in to a variable
              gray = cv.cvtColor(img_array, cv.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) # make b&w
  
              faces_rect = haar_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.1,
                                                                  minNeighbors=4)
  
              for (x,y,w,h) in faces_rect:
                  faces_roi = gray[y:y+h, x:x+w] # we have now extracted a face roi
                  features.append(faces_roi) # add face rectangle to features
                  labels.append(label) # add label to labels 
  
  
  create_train()
  ```

#### Training and Saving the Recognizer

- Convert the features and labels lists into numpy arrays. Give features the dtype `object`:
  
  ```python
  features = np.array(features, dtype='object')
  labels = np.array(labels)
  ```

- First create an instance of the recognizer:
  
  ```python
  face_recognizer = cv.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer_create()
  ```

- Then we can **train** the recognizer on our **features** and **labels** lists:
  
  ```python
  face_recognizer.train(features, labels)
  ```

- And save the model as a **.yml** and the lists as **.npy** with:
  
  ```python
  face_recognizer.save('face_trained.yml')
  np.save('features.npy', features)
  np.save('labels.npy', labels)
  ```

#### Recognizing Faces

- We can use our saved files in a new program. First load in the Haar cascade, our features, labels, and recognizer:
  
  ```python
  features = np.load('features.npy')
  features = np.load('labels.npy')
  
  face_recognizer = cv.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer_create()
  face_recognizer.read('face_train.yml')
  ```

- Now just create a test image
  
  ```python
  img = cv.imread('Faces\val\elton_john\2.jpg')
  gray = cv.cvtColor(img, cv.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
  cv.imshow('Person', gray)
  ```

- And detect faces:
