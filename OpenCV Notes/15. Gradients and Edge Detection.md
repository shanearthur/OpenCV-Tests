# Gradients and Edge Detection

- **Gradients** and **edges** are <u>completely</u> different from a *mathematical* perspective, but we can mostly get away with thinking of them as the same from a *programming* perspective.

- The **Canny** edge detecor is a popular and complex way to detect edges, but we will be learning two alternative ways to do this: **Laplacian** and **Sobel** methods.

#### Laplacian Method

- **Laplacian()** takes in a source image, and a data depth (use `cv.CV_64F` for now).

- Then, we need to use this second line of code which must convert the data type? (Under the hood, the algorithm is finding where black and white convert to each other and giving them a positive or negative **slope**. Because images can't have negative pixel values, we need to convert them to absolute values then to the data type of an image.)
  
  ```python
  lap = cv.Laplacian(gray, cv.CV_64F)
  lap = np.uint8(np.absolute(lap))
  ```

- The Laplacian Edges will ultimately look like the image has been drawn with a pencil and then lightly smudged.

#### Sobel Method

- The Sobel method computes gradients in both x and y directions.

- To do this we need to create a Sobel edge detection for each axis using **Sobel()** which takes in a source image, a data depth (`cv.CV_64F`), and then a boolean for x axis and a boolean for y axis:
  
  ```python
  sobelx = cv.Sobel(gray, cv.CV_64F, 1, 0)
  sobely = cv.Sobel(gray, cv.CV_64F, 0, 1)
  ```

- We combine these using **bitwise_or()**:
  
  ```python
  combined_sobel = cv.bitwise_or(sobelx, sobely)
  ```

******Canny uses Sobel within it's algorithm!******
