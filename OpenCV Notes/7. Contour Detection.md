- **Contours** are the boundaries of objects.
- They are useful in shape analysis and object recognition.
- Mathematically, they are not the same as edges.
- It can be a good idea to blur your image before finding contours.
- Once you have edge detected a frame (grayscale then canny) you can find contours using the **findCountours()** method which returns **contours** and **hierarchies** and accepts as arguments the source edges, and a mode, and a method:
	Modes (how it finds the contours):
		cv.RETR_TREE : will get all hierarchichal contours
		cv.RETR_EXTERNAL : will get all external contours
		cv.RETR_LIST : will get all contours
	Methods (which of the found contours it returns):
	    cv.CHAIN_APPROX_NONE : does nothing. Returns all contours.
		cv.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE: returns contours that "make most sense".
- **Returned contours** is a python list of all the coordinates of all the contours found in the image.
- **Returned hierarchies** is... complex. Can study elsewhere if necessary.
- We can print the number of contours with:
	`print(f'{len(contours)} contour(s) found!')`
- Alternatively to find the number of contours, we can use **threshold()** to *binarize* an image. We can pass it three arguments: a source image, a threshold (0-255 where all pixels below the threshold intensity are set to black), a maxvalue (if above threshold, set to this value), and a type (cv.THRESH_BINARY). 

- Generally, just try to use **findContours()** on a **canny** image.
