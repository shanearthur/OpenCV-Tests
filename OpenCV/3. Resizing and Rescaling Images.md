- Resizing and rescaling is usually done to limit the amount of information we're needing to deal with.
- **Rescaling** modifies the image to a given height and width. You generally want to rescale *smaller* then the original dimensions.
- We can rescale by writing the following function:
```python
def rescaleFrame(frame, scale=0.75):
	width = int(frame.shape[1] * scale)
	height = int(frame.shape[0] * scale)
	dimensions = (width, height)

	return cv.resize(frame, dimensions, interpolation=cv.INTER_AREA)
```
- `frame.shape[1]` is the width of your frame.
- `frame.shape[0]` is the height of your frame.
- **dimensions** stores our scaled dimensions.
- **resize()** resizes our frame by a particular dimension (a tuple I think).

- You can rescale **ONLY LIVE VIDEOS** easily by using the **capture.set()** function. The first argument is the property of the video. There are 18 of these:
	- 0 = position of video file in milliseconds
	- 1 = index of frame to be captured next
	- 2 = relative position of video file
	- 3 = width of frames
	- 4 = height of frames
	- 5 = frame rate
	- 10 = brightness
	- 15 = exposure

```python
def changeRes(width, height):
	capture.set(3, width)
	capture.set(4, height)
```
- Converts the properties of the image to new width and height.
