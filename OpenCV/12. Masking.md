# Masking

- **Masking** allows us to focus on a specific part of an image using bitwise operators.

- To make a mask, we start by making a blank image the same size as the source image:
  
  ```python
  blank = np.zeros(img.shape[:2], dtype='uint8')
  ```

- Then we draw a shape on the blank image:
  
  ```python
  mask = cv.circle(blank, (img.shape[1]//2, img.shape[0]//2), 100, 255, -1)
  ```

- Then we can create the masked image by using **bitwise_and()** to combine the img with the mask (use source image for both `src1` and `src2`  arguments and apply mask as a specific argument):
  
  ```python
  masked = cv.bitwise_and(img, img, mask=mask)
  ```

- We can also use the bitwise operators to create custom max shapes, just remember that *the mask has to be the same size as the image it is masking*.
