- Import OpenCV with `import cv2 as cv`

#### Reading Images
- Create an object to represent the image with **imread()** and the target file.
	`img = cv.imread('Photos/cat.jpg')`
- Show the image with **imshow()** giving it a window name and image object.
	`cv.imshow('Cat', img)`
- Add **waitKey(0)** so that open window waits indefinitely for keyboard input.

#### Reading Video
- Create a capture variable and set it to **VideoCapture()**. Argument can be either the path to a video file or an integer for connected cameras.
	`capture = cv.VideoCapture(1)`
- We use a **while loop** to read in videos frame by frame.
```python
while True:
	isTrue, frame = capture.read()
	cv.imshow('Video', frame)

	if cv.waitKey(20) & 0xFF==ord('d'):
		break

capture.release()
cv.destroyAllWindows()
```
- **capture.read()** reads in the video frame by frame, returning the frame and a boolean based on whether the frame was read successfully or not.
- **imshow()** displays each frame of the video.
- **waitkey(20)** accepts key input for 20 seconds then returns `-1`.
- `0xFF==ord('d')` returns if the letter 'd' on the keyboard is pressed.
- **capture.release()** ends communication with the capture device or file.
- **destroyAllWindows()** obviously closes all windows that were created.

- **-215:Assertion failed error** indicates that OpenCV could not find a media file at that location. It will often happen at the end of a video file that runs out of frames.
