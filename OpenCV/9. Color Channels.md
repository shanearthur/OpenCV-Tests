- An RGB or BGR image consists of three channels mergred together: red, green, and blue.
- OpenCV lets you **split** these channels.
- **split()** takes in a source image and splits the channels in to three variables: `b,g,r = cv.split(img)`
- These computed variables are a grayscale image of the intensity of *only that color channel*.
- **.shape** will return the height, width, and number of channels.
- **merge()** takes in a vector of elements to merge together!
	`merged = cv.merge([b,g,r])`
- We can **merge()** together single split channels with a blank array to create an image of only the channel color.
```python
img = cv.imread('Photos/park.jpg')
cv.imshow('Park', img)

blank = np.zeros(img.shape[:2], dtype='uint8')

b,g,r = cv.split(img)

blue = cv.merge([b, blank, blank])
green = cv.merge([blank, g, blank])
red = cv.merge([blank, blank, r]) 

cv.imshow('Only b', blue)
cv.imshow('Only g', green)
cv.imshow('Only r', red)
```
