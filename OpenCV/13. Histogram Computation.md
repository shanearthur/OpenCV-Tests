# Histogram Computation

- **Histograms** allow us to visuallize the distribution of pixel intensities in an image.

- You can compute histograms for grayscale and RGB images.

- The function for computing a histogram is **calcHist()** which takes in a *list* of source images, a *list* of channels that we want to compute, a mask (which can be set to `None`), a histogram size as a list of "bins" to use while computing, and a *list* of the range of posisble pixel values (typically `[0,256]`):
  
  ```python
  histogram = cv.calcHist([image], [channels], None, [bins], [minval,maxval])
  ```

#### Grayscale Histograms

- Make sure to compute on a grayscale image:
  
  ```python
  gray_hist = cv.calcHist([gray], [0], None, [256], [0,256])
  ```

#### Masking and Histograms

- We can compute the histogram for a subsection of an image by creating a mask shape, applying it to the image, and then passing in the masked image as the mask argument in **calcHist()**:
  
  ```python
  circle = cv.circle(blank, (img.shape[1]//2, img.shape[0]//2), 100, 255, -1)
  mask = cv.bitwise_and(gray,gray,mask=circle)
  gray_hist = cv.calcHist([gray], [0], mask, [256], [0,256])
  ```

#### Color Histograms

- To define a color histogram, first define a tuple of the color channels:
  
  ```python
  colors = ('b', 'g', 'r')
  ```

- Then we can enumerate over each color
  
  ```python
  for i, col in enumerate(colors):
      hist = cv.calcHist([img], [i], None, [256], [0,256])
      plt.plot(hist, color=col)
      plt.xlim([0,256]) # this is just aesthetic
  ```

- Don't forget you must run **figure()** above this and **show()** below it.
