- You can switch between color spaces in OpenCV.
- **Color spaces** are a system of representing an array of pixels as colors. (RGB, Grayscale, BGR, HSV, LAB, etc.)
- By default, OpenCv reads in images in the BGR color space.
- Again, the **cvtColor()** converts the color space by taking in a source image and a color code:
	- Grayscale: COLOR_BGR2GRAY
		- **Grayscale** may just look black and white, but mathematically it is showing the intensity of each pixel.
	- Hue Saturation Value: COLOR_BGR2HSV
		- **HSV** is closer to how human vision perceives color-making attributes.
	- LAB: COLOR_BGR2LAB
		- **LAB** is also for accuracy to how humans see. Will study.
	- RGB: COLOR_BGR2RGB
		- **RGB** will be what other programs and libraries often use, so you will likely convert to this one often. 
- We can convert all of these back to BGR, but to convert between them you would need to convert to BGR then to the target color space.
