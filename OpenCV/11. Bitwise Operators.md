- There are four basic bitwise operators: **AND, OR, XOR, NOT**.

- We use bitwise operators in computer vision when dealing with masks. If a pixel is turned *off* it has a value of 0. If it is turned *on*, it has a value of 1.

- **bitwise_and()** takes in two source images and returns the *intersecting* regions.
    `bitwise_and = cv.bitwise_and(rectangle, circle)`

- **bitwise_or()** takes in two source images and returns the *intersecting and non-intersecting* regions.
    `bitwise_or = cv.bitwise_or(rectangle, circle)`

- **bitwise_xor()** takes in two source images and returns the *non intersecting* regions.
    `bitwise_xor = cv.bitwise_xor(rectangle, circle)`

- **bitwise_not()** takes in **one** source image and inverts the binary color.
    `bitwise_not = cv.bitwise_not(rectangle)`
