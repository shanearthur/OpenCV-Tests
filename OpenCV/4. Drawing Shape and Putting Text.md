****NOTE: OPENCV USES 'BGR' VALUES NOT 'RGB'****

#### Drawing Shapes
- We can either draw directly on existing images or create a blank image to work with by creating an array of zeros: 
	`blank = np.zeros((500,500), dtype='uint8'`
	- 'uint8' is essentially the data type of an image.
	- If you are going to be using color, you need to pass in a variable for the number of color channels: `np.zeros(500,500,3)`

- To change the color of the blank image, simply change the color if each item in the array with `blank[:] = 0,255,0`. (This would turn it green.)

- To change the color of a *portion* of the blank image, simply apply the same process to a subset of the array element: `blank[200:300, 300:400]`
	- Remember here that the first index refers to the 'y' axis!
- This could also be done using **rectangle()** where the arguments are the image to draw on, pt1, pt2, color, and then thickness and linetype if required.
- To fill the rectangle with the color, set thickness to `cv.FILLED` or `-1`.
- You could also use the image dimensions to set the dimensions:
	`cv.rectangle(blank, (0,0), (blank.shape[1]//2, blank.shape[0]//2), 0,255,0)` (Note that '//' is used here, not '/'.)
	
- A circle can be drawn with **circle()** which takes in an image to draw on, a center to draw the circle, a radius, a color, and optional thickness/linetype.
- A line can be drawn with **line()** which takes in an image to draw on, pt1, pt2, color, thickness/linetype optionally.

#### Writing Text
- **putText()** will put text on an image. Arguments are an image to draw on, the text in quotes, a point to draw from, a fontFace, a fontScale, color, and optional thickness/linetype.
`cv.putText(blank, 'Hello', (255,255), cv.FONT_HERSHEY_TRIPEX, 1.0, (0,255,0), 2)
